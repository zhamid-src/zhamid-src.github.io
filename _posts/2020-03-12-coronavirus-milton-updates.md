This is me writing as an individual and not on behalf of any organization.

Globally, ~3.4% of reported cases of coronavirus end up in fatality. The number for seasonal flu is < 1% (1). That said, the death rate is high for 85+, it's actually quite low for people under 40. (2)

| AGE             | Death Rate    |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 80+ years old   | 14.8%         |
| 70-79 years old | 8.0%          |
| 60-69 years old | 3.6%          |
| 50-59 years old | 1.3%          |
| 40-49 years old | 0.4%          |
| 30-39 years old | 0.2%          |
| 20-29 years old | 0.2%          |
| 10-19 years old | 0.2%          |
| 0-9 years old   | no fatalities |

One problem with coronavirus is that it's more infectious than flu and now scientists say that it might have mutated into a more aggressive form (3)

**IT'S NOT A REASON TO PANIC**, here are some helpful tips (summary: disinfect your phone, don't touch your face, wash hands often, esp. after every outing) :-

1. Today at an event some people bumped fists instead of shaking hands. That's actually a good idea.
2. Avoid touching your face
3. Wash your hands often, especially before eating / touching your face.
4. The virus can live up to 96 hours on phone screens (4)
5. Carry disinfectant. Use it.
6. Keep disinfectant in your home, esp. near the entrance. Have people use it as they enter (better to actually wash hands with soap)
7. Cough into your elbow
8. Avoid poorly ventilated places (5)
9. _DO NOT GO OUT TO BUY FACE MASKS_. If you have extra ones, consider donating. They won't help you if you aren't already infected.

**Typical symptoms:**
Fever (87.9%), dry coughing (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), joint pain (14.8%), chills (11.4%).
