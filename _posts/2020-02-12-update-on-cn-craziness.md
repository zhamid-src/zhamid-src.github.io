5+ years later, the fight for fairness and rules continues.

If you don't have the background on the CN issue then please take a look at [this old blog post](https://zeehamid4.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/so-whats-the-issue-with-cn-anyway/) and [halton.ca/cn](halton.ca/cn) since I won't repeat the information already shared.

Milton will have _30,000 people_ living within 1km of this facility, if it goes through.

Despite CN's confident announcements that it was going to start the construction in 2015, we were able to convince the Federal government to order an environmental assessment. The assessment came back and recognized that the project is likely to cause **significant adverse enviromental effects on the air quality, human health and wildlife habitat.**

Among other very problematic contaminants are Benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, PM10 and PM2.5. If you aren't familiar, then there is no safe quantity of PM2.5 (anything above 0 is harmful).

In addition, the assessment identified 220 measures that must be enforced, otherwise there would be more negative health issues related to night-time lighting, noise, surface water, groundwater, wetlands, terrestrial environment, fish mortality, species at risk, migratory birds, habitat connectivity, human health and aggriculture.

**Here's the kicker: a majority of these 220 measures are not enforceable on CN because CN does not reconize Provincial and Municipal jurisdiction, and the Feds cannot enforce them.**

And we haven't even talked about hundreds of millions of dollars in lost property taxes and development charges.

**So, what are the next steps?**

The decision now belongs to the Minister. If the Minister decides the project is likely to cause adverse effects then the decision goes to the Cabinet to decide whether these effects are 'justified in the circumstances'.

**And that's where you come in!**

We need you to apply political pressure on area MPs and Federal Ministers. This project is not justifiable. It will result in adverse health impact on most of Milton and south Oakville. The rest of Halton will suffer the traffic impact and incredible costs due to lost taxes.

So please contact the following members and let them know that you don't want CN in the current area, and instead it should go into heavy industrial zoning where it belongs.
