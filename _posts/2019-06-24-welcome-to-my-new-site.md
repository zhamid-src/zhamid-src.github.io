After 10+ years of a WordPress-based site with 400+ blog posts, I've decided to redo my site as static HTML pages.

I found that the WordPress site slowed down over time. My options were to pay even more for a beefier hosting, or re-create the site using static HTML. I opted for option \#2.&nbsp;

The end result is that the new site is 20x faster and best of all, I get to host it for free (hosting on github, since some people asked).&nbsp;

I decided not to migrate old posts to this site. Instead, I archived them here: [https://zeehamid4.wordpress.com/](https://zeehamid4.wordpress.com/)&nbsp;. If you have an old link to a specific post then it will be redirected automatically. New posts will be published on this site.&nbsp;

Hope you enjoy it.&nbsp;
