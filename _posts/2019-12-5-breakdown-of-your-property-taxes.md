I hope this is shared widely because there's a lot of misinformation out there.

Curious to know how your property tax dollars are distributed in Milton? This chart should help.

Please keep in mind that this only includes tax-supported spending (most spending is paid for by provincial subsidies, user fees, development charges, grants, etc that isn't shown here). I also lumped some categories for simplicity, otherwise the chart became too wide.
