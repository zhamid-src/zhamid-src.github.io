        <title>Some Coronavirus Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is me writing as an individual and not on behalf of any organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, ~3.4% of reported cases of coronavirus end up in fatality. The number for seasonal flu is &amp;lt; 1% (1). That said, the death rate is high for 85+, it’s actually quite low for people under 40. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;AGE&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Death Rate&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;80+ years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;14.8%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;70-79 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8.0%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;60-69 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3.6%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;50-59 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.3%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;40-49 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.4%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;30-39 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20-29 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10-19 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0-9 years old&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;no fatalities&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with coronavirus is that it’s more infectious than flu and now scientists say that it might have mutated into a more aggressive form (3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT’S NOT A REASON TO PANIC&lt;/strong&gt;, here are some helpful tips (summary: disinfect your phone, don’t touch your face, wash hands often, esp. after every outing) :-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Today at an event some people bumped fists instead of shaking hands. That’s actually a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid touching your face&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wash your hands often, especially before eating / touching your face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The virus can live up to 96 hours on phone screens (4)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carry disinfectant. Use it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep disinfectant in your home, esp. near the entrance. Have people use it as they enter (better to actually wash hands with soap)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cough into your elbow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid poorly ventilated places (5)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT GO OUT TO BUY FACE MASKS&lt;/em&gt;. If you have extra ones, consider donating. They won’t help you if you aren’t already infected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt;
Fever (87.9%), dry coughing (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), joint pain (14.8%), chills (11.4%). Full list: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452-f1?fbclid=IwAR2_iYNoKa4JxHdiBESJ757PvBiqi6S_YshrBc2b-nImHDQ5Ym3LXkZxxbE&quot;&gt;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452-f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take proper precautions and don’t panic. Feel free to share this information with others.

        <title>Update on the CN craziness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;5+ years later, the fight for fairness and rules continues.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cargostar.uz/uploads/1/8/3/6/18369469/w-806-450-horni-dust-7095e_orig.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Train hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have the background on the CN issue then please take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeehamid4.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/so-whats-the-issue-with-cn-anyway/&quot;&gt;this old blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;halton.ca/cn&quot;&gt;halton.ca/cn&lt;/a&gt; since I won’t repeat the information already shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milton will have &lt;em&gt;30,000 people&lt;/em&gt; living within 1km of this facility, if it goes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite CN’s confident announcements that it was going to start the construction in 2015, we were able to convince the Federal government to order an environmental assessment. The assessment came back and recognized that the project is likely to cause &lt;strong&gt;significant adverse enviromental effects on the air quality, human health and wildlife habitat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other very problematic contaminants are Benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, PM10 and PM2.5. If you aren’t familiar, then there is no safe quantity of PM2.5 (anything above 0 is harmful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the assessment identified 220 measures that must be enforced, otherwise there would be more negative health issues related to night-time lighting, noise, surface water, groundwater, wetlands, terrestrial environment, fish mortality, species at risk, migratory birds, habitat connectivity, human health and aggriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the kicker: a majority of these 220 measures are not enforceable on CN because CN does not reconize Provincial and Municipal jurisdiction, and the Feds cannot enforce them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we haven’t even talked about hundreds of millions of dollars in lost property taxes and development charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what are the next steps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision now belongs to the Minister. If the Minister decides the project is likely to cause adverse effects then the decision goes to the Cabinet to decide whether these effects are ‘justified in the circumstances’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that’s where you come in!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need you to apply political pressure on area MPs and Federal Ministers. This project is not justifiable. It will result in adverse health impact on most of Milton and south Oakville. The rest of Halton will suffer the traffic impact and incredible costs due to lost taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please contact the following members and let them know that you don’t want CN in the current area, and instead it should go into heavy industrial zoning where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Milton passes a 2.86% overall tax increase on the local budget increase of 5.68%</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Town of Milton continues to be the lowest-taxed jurisdiction, with property taxes well below other municipalities in the surrounding area. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/QD6nYTQ/ELc-YTz-DW4-AAUGGa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Milton's rate compared to other municipalities&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing a challenging budget, the council passed an &lt;strong&gt;overall tax increase of 2.86%&lt;/strong&gt; based on Milton’s budget increase of 5.63%. This allowed the council to reverse cuts to tree plantings, delays in park construction, protect the community fund and save Saturday transit. The budget also continues to set aside money for infrastructure reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This budget makes important investments in both services and infrastructure in our community.” &lt;br /&gt;
Budget Chair, Councillor Mike Cluett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget spends $78M in capital projects, the majorty of these in roads based on the feedback from residents. This includes roadway expansions such as Thompson Road (Britannia Road to Louis St. Laurent Avenue), Louis St. Laurent Avenue (Fourth Line to James Snow Parkway), Fifth Line (Hwy 401 to Derry Road) and Bronte Street (Main Street to Steeles Avenue). Increased funding will go towards maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roadways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’m greatly encouraged that council withstood the temptation to dip further into  reserves as a method of funding operating costs.”&lt;br /&gt;
Ward 3 Councillor Rick Di Lorenzo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, a fifth Fire Station is planned to open near Regional Road 25 and Louis St. Laurent and the Sherwood Community Centre will celebrate its first full year of operation. These new facilities help to maintain and deliver important services to Milton’s growing community. Based on the Youth Strategy recommendations, approved in 2019, the Town will also implement a pilot project in 2020 focusing on youth-specific spaces and programming at facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Milton is a great place to live. This budget maintains our tax advantage while protecting services our residents have come to rely on.”&lt;br /&gt;
Councillor Zeeshan Hamid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to protecting key services, the council also supported Councillor Sameera Ali’s motion to bring forward Bowes Neighbourhood Community Park in ward 4 by 4 years and Councillor Zeeshan Hamid’s motion to add windrow cleaning for all seniors and people of disability who were on the long wating list. Councillor Hamid’s motion of not cutting tree plantings down by 300 (from 750) was also supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, the budget did not receive the approval of Mayor Krantz and Councillors Best and Malbeouf, who all wanted to see further cuts to bring the local share down from 5.63% to 5%. “That represents less than a dollar a month”, said Councillor Hamid, voicing his concern that “bringing the rate down to that level requires cutting Saturday transit and the community fund, or cutting the Moffat park redevelopment completely. How can you tell people they don’t get the services they rely on to save less than a buck.”  Councillor Sameera Ali expressed her satisfaction that the budget supported significant infrastructure programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am happy that we are moving forward with a budget that brings us closer to filling the growth and infrastructure gap.”&lt;br /&gt;
Councillor Sameera Ali&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final budget passed with a vote of 6-3. For the average single detached home in Milton, the Town’s 2020 budget will result in an additional $88.21 per year ($7.35 per month).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breakdown Of Your Property Taxes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope this is shared widely because there’s a lot of misinformation out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to know how your property tax dollars are distributed in Milton? This chart should help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this only includes tax-supported spending (most spending is paid for by provincial subsidies, user fees, development charges, grants, etc that isn’t shown here). I also lumped some categories for simplicity, otherwise the chart became too wide.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taxes and Services - How to Balance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on new ways of looking at Milton’s taxes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you keep hearing, Milton has the lowest taxes in GTA by far. In fact, we are 30% below the average of neighbouring municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It creates a challenge where we’re unable to provide similar services without raiding our reserves and risking our future financial health. In fact, raiding reserves is something the council will likely do again next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our staff is recommending a better (IMO) approach, one I’ve argued for in the past as well since I prefer concrete, measurable (and achievable) goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set a goal of staying 15% below the lower of Burlington and Halton Hills (which both have low taxes themselves). That’s a reasonable way of saying we’re “efficient” at providing services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add an additional goal to provide each service at a cost that’s 20% below the average of other municipalities. This gives you a measurable way of ensuring we’re efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of the two will 1) keep our taxes low, 2) provide services you deserve, and 3) demonstrate that we’re providing each service in a very cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current approach of driving taxes as low as possible no matter what the cost isn’t working. It’s taking us to a financial disaster where every analysis shows that we will not be able to maintain all the roads and parks we have developers build using development charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? Let me know: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:zee.hamid@milton.ca&quot;&gt;zee.hamid@milton.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I am not adding a poll intentionally since I am more interested in hearing your thoughts).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lead in municipal water</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked me and other councillors questions about media reports that found lead in water. Here are some details from the regional staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak for others, but in Halton region the potential for lead in our drinking water system is extremely low. In fact, we have one of the highest compliance ratings – over 99% compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our high compliance rating is a result of all the proactive and continuous measures Halton Region has taken over the past decade to ensure we are delivering the safest and highest quality drinking water possible. In 2007, the Region undertook a Cast Iron Watermain Replacement Program. This program identified and replaced all old cast iron watermains in Halton Region, while at the same time replacing all known lead public service lines and connections. Since that time, all known public lead service lines and connections have been replaced. As part of our continuous monitoring, we investigate the neighborhood for the presence of lead as part of any watermain project or at the time of a water main break. If lead is observed, Halton Region takes immediate corrective action and replaces the service line or connection. Since the Cast Iron Watermain Replacement Program was completed, lead services have been observed 3 times within the public right-of-way and those services were removed. Moreover, if a lead service line was observed, on private property, the homeowners were notified and provided with guidance on private side corrective actions required (e.g., replacement of private service lines and indoor plumbing, or flushing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these programs, we have been helping homeowners check for the presence of lead to ensure safe drinking water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Halton has recently replaced over 14,000 water meters in older areas of Halton Region as part of the Pulse Water Meter Replacement Program. Of the 14,000 homes that have had their meter replaced through the program, no private water services was observed to be lead.· We will continue to look for the presence of lead water services on the private property side through the upcoming Advanced Meter Replacement (AMI) program, where all homes will be required to have their meters upgraded or replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Halton’s drinking water is safe and the risk of lead is very low, there may be lead in the water from pipe fittings and connections in older homes (e.g. build prior to the 1960’s). We are helping to educate residents on how to check their plumbing. If a resident has any concerns, we will be sending a Halton representative to check their connections and provide guidance on corrective actions required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I would like to confirm that students were not exposed to water that exceeded the Provincial limit for lead at White Oaks Secondary School in Oakville. The 140 µg/L level reported in the Globe and Mail was the result from a standing water sample taken during the summer. This test occurred before the school opened for the school year, corrective actions were taken as part of the requirements and resampling of flushed water (water that would be consumed) was within the acceptable provincial limit for lead. School Boards are responsible under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 2002 to conduct regular lead testing, pipe flushing and pipe replacements to ensure the safety of the water within schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health and safety of our residents is our number one priority. We will continue our surveillance measures and control programs to ensure we meet the drinking water quality standards and provide our residents with the assurance that our water is high quality and safe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to my new site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After 10+ years of a WordPress-based site with 400+ blog posts, I’ve decided to redo my site as static HTML pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that the WordPress site slowed down over time. My options were to pay even more for a beefier hosting, or re-create the site using static HTML. I opted for option #2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is that the new site is 20x faster and best of all, I get to host it for free (hosting on github, since some people asked). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to migrate old posts to this site. Instead, I archived them here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeehamid4.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;https://zeehamid4.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt; . If you have an old link to a specific post then it will be redirected automatically. New posts will be published on this site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;
